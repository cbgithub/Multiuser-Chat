# Multiuser Chat #
This was a group project that was done in my CS 450(Networking) class. The instructions were to create a Multi-Chat room with a GUI that contains a JTextarea, JTextFields, JButtons and JLabels and a Thread that handles all the incoming messages using a multicastsocket and datagrampacket. This project was completely within two weeks.

# My Role#
I assisted with writing the thread as well as connecting the buttons from the GUI to the thread.

# Tools#
<ul>
<li> JDK </li>
 </ul>

# Features#
  <ul>
    <li><b>Join Chat - </b>
     when running the GUI, the user can type in any multicast ip address and join the chat.
    </li>
    <li><b>Leave Chat - </b>
     This allows the user to leave the chat room that he or she joined. 
    </li>
     <li><b>Send Message - </b>
     This allows the user to send a message to everyone in the chat room.
    </li>
     <li><b>Exit - </b>
     This allows the user to exit the whole program.
    </li>
  </ul>


# Installation#
To test the chat application on only one computer download this <a href="https://github.com/cbgithub/Multiuser-Chat/blob/master/MultiCastDemo1.jar?raw=true">jar1</a> file and this <a href="https://github.com/cbgithub/Multiuser-Chat/blob/master/MultiCastDemo2.jar?raw=true">jar2</a> file. Then open both applications, type in the same <a href= "http://www.iana.org/assignments/multicast-addresses/multicast-addresses.xhtml">multicast Ip address</a> and press join. After that send as many messages as you want. To test the chat application on two different computers download only one jar file per computer, type in same multicast Ip address, join and then send messages.
