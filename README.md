#Multiuser Chat#
This was a group project that was done in my CS 450(Networking) class. The instructions were to create a GUI that contains a JTextarea, JTextFields, JButtons and JLabels and a Thread that handles all the incoming messages using a multicastsocket and datagrampacket. This project was completely within two weeks.
